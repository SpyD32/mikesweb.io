        <h3>My New Journey</h3>
        <p>The 2020 Pandemic brought a lot of unexpected twists and turns. I experienced job loss along with countless others. I also became a father in the midst of the world turning completely upside down. I decided to take a leap of faith and bridge my two passions together. I have an undeniable love for graphic design and have done freelancing projects for local businesses. My other passion is web development. My curiosity for problem solving and love for the tech world fueled my continual growth and educational development.  This website is a testament that you can achieve your dreams even in the middle of an unprecedented time’s.
